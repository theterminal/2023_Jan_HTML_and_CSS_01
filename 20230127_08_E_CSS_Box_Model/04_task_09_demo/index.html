        >Interesting fact is that the browser is adding a space after an 'enter' at the end of an element. That space is a problem when working on the edge with percentage with and so on. A hack that fixes this problem is to do the following: [.container *: font-size 16px; ] - it is just an example.<br>Another way is to give 0px to the font-size and the rendering of the elements will be OK but the text will dissappear.</span>
      <span class="second text">Another interesting declaration is the width of the current element [ width: calc(20% - 10px); ]</span>
