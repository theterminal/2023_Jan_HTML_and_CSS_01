      <p>All elements have initial <b>z-index: 0</b>. If two or more elements have same index value, they will appear on the screen based on their order in the HTML document (the later in the HTML the higher priority).</p>

      <p>The higher the z-index the closer to you is the element. z-index is the <b>'z' axis</b> of the coordinate system with <b>'0 position'</b> at the screen level. There are negative indexes also...</p>

      <p>It is possible to use <b>'z-index'</b> as a group but the container of the group must <b>NOT</b> have <b>'position: static'</b>. It must be positioned with some other value than 'static'.</p>
      
      <p>The elements inside a container which container has z-index set, have z-index of the container comparing the z-indexes of all elements outside of the container but inside the container the elements are compairing to one another with their z-indexes. The actual z-indexes inside the container matter between the elements inside but as far as outside the container the group has the z-index of the container...</p>

      <p>See the example above. The elements 4, 5, 6 are in a group with <b>z-index: 20</b> of the group.</p>
